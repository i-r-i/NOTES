## Production of Election Beams
An electron gun is a gun that produces electrons.

## Electron Beams in Magnetic Fields
If an electron beam is directed through a magnetic field the electrons will deflect. The direction of deflection can be found through Flemming's Left Hand Rule.
Taking the direction of the electron beam to be the current, apply the rule as normal to see whether it will be deflected up or down.

The force (F) on a charge (Q) moving in an electric field (E) and a magnetic field (B) with a speed (B) can be modelled with this equation.  
```F = Q(E + v CROSS B)```  
In a situation where the EFS is 0 and a charge is moving at right angles to the magnetic flux density  
```F = BQv```  
And when B = 0, ```E = F/Q```  
Since ```v = l/t``` if a particle travels distance l in time t, ```I = Q/t``` and ```F = BIL``` the force can be written ```F = BQl/t``` or ```F = BQv```
